This section includes advice on how to build new features for the project & what kind of process it includes.

* This is how we like people to add new features:  
Adapting the flow to non-JAVA project.  
Setting up the testing baseline. When the code does not pass the baseline, stop deploying.  
Send email or SMS when the execution fails.
* Here are some specifics on the coding style we prefer:
* This is how you send your pull request:
* You should include the following tests:
* These are the updates we hope you make to the changelog:

Don’t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the

# Bug triage

This sections explains how bug triaging is done for your project. Help beginners by including examples to good bug reports and providing them questions they should look to answer.

    * Is it reproducible in other environments (for instance, on different browsers or devices)?
    * Are the steps to reproduce the bug clear? If not, can you describe how you might reproduce it?
    * What tags should the bug have?
    * Is this bug something you have run into? Would you appreciate it being looked into faster?

* You can close fixed bugs by testing old tickets to see if they are still happening.
